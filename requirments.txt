PROJECT NAME
Website Uptime & Performance Monitor (Python)

PURPOSE
Build an automated Python tool that monitors website availability and performance,
records results, and runs unattended for long periods.

GOAL
Learn real-world automation practices:
- Networking
- Error handling
- Logging
- Scheduling
- Data recording
- Maintainable structure

--------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (WHAT IT MUST DO)
--------------------------------------------------

1. WEBSITE MONITORING
- Monitor one or more websites (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Perform periodic checks at a configurable interval
- Measure:
  - HTTP status code
  - Response time
- Decide and record:
  - UP state
  - DOWN state

2. FAILURE HANDLING
- Handle:
  - Invalid domains
  - Timeouts
  - No internet
  - SSL / connection errors
- The program must NOT crash on failures
- Failures must be recorded, not ignored

3. DATA RECORDING
- Store monitoring results in a persistent file
- Each record must include:
  - Timestamp
  - Website URL
  - Status (UP/DOWN)
  - HTTP code (if available)
  - Response time (or null/empty if failed)

4. LOGGING
- Maintain a log file for system behavior
- Log:
  - Successful checks
  - Failures
  - Exceptions
- Logs must be readable after days/weeks

5. AUTOMATION
- Run continuously without manual input
- Support safe restart without corrupting data
- No hardcoded values for URLs or intervals

--------------------------------------------------
NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (HOW IT SHOULD BE)
--------------------------------------------------

1. CONFIGURATION
- Websites list must be configurable
- Interval must be configurable
- Timeout must be configurable
- Configuration must be editable without touching code

2. STRUCTURE
- Clear folder separation:
  - source
  - logs
  - reports
- Easy to understand for another developer

3. STABILITY
- Program should survive:
  - Temporary network loss
  - Single website failure
- One failure must not stop monitoring others

4. EXTENSIBILITY
- Design should allow future features:
  - Alerts (email/telegram)
  - Charts
  - Daily summaries
  - Cloud deployment

--------------------------------------------------
CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------------------------

- Use Python
- Prefer standard libraries where possible
- Third-party libraries must be minimal and justified
- No GUI required
- No machine learning
- No web framework

--------------------------------------------------
SUCCESS CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------

The project is considered successful if:
- It runs for several hours unattended
- It records both UP and DOWN states correctly
- It does not crash on bad input or network errors
- Logs and reports clearly explain what happened

--------------------------------------------------
TESTING CHECKLIST
--------------------------------------------------

- Test with a valid website
- Test with an invalid URL
- Test with internet disconnected
- Restart the program mid-run
- Let the program run for extended time
- Verify logs and reports after failures

--------------------------------------------------
OUT OF SCOPE (FOR NOW)
--------------------------------------------------

- Notifications (email, Telegram, Slack)
- Dashboards
- Databases
- Cloud hosting
- Authentication systems
